# Transition Path Sampling with Diffusion Path Samplers
[![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-2405.19961-84cc16)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19961)

This repository contains the code to reproduce the results of [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19961) (ICLR 2025) and [project page](https://kiyoung98.github.io/tps-dps/) for 3D videos of transition paths sampled from our diffusion path sampler.

## Installation
We provide a script for installing packages (assuming CUDA 11.x).
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate tps-dps
```

## Quickstart: Synthetic Double-Well Example
We provide self-contained notebook `double-well.ipynb` for training TPS-DPS and sampling transition paths in a synthetic double-well system.

## Steps to reproduce the results
We provide instructions to reproduce the results of aldp and train a new model. You can replace aldp with fast-folding proteins: chignolin, trpcage, bba, and bbl.

- **Sampling**: Run the following command to sample transition paths.
    ```
    bash scripts/sample/aldp.sh
    ```
- **Evaluation**: Run the following command to evaluate sampled paths.
    ```
    bash scripts/eval/aldp.sh
    ```
- **Training**: Run the following command to start training from scratch. For better results, please try many seeds.
    ```
    bash scripts/train/aldp.sh
    ```
